Hacker stuff
i am not computer or software provra
ner. i wrote Hello World in Fortan 77( got an A!). My last job used 1 million lines of Fortran but that was computer guys problem. im hardware ( have a degree). i had my personal Macbook hacked in November ( long story they thought i stole a video i bought it and they didnt check one bit. i got fired 16 months before i met the minimum retirement age. Mac, laptop, iphone, tablet, and car were destroyed. 

i dont know the word it is not stealing, but they broke into my icloud that had 2FA, that double encryption, no internet access, and physical keys. a total of 5 accounts. ive talked to the American and i think he realizes i did not steal. hes like a white knight right fighter. hes been leaving easter eggs for me to find. 

but i learned a lot and got a lot of tools. spectrum has this roving router thing i dont know the word. you are not at home but you click wifi. i think they have broken into spectrum router and are running tons of data thtough it. this phone is mirrored and i can prove it a problem i factory reset a lot  
anyway they deleted 600 GB of a particular thing that i have collected ( all super HD even the old ones) since 1992. all paid. 
gone. i went to the deep web to retrieve some of my loss. The Russians had about 1/3 frer. the hacker deleted them and said no more doing that ( i must also excerse and meet new peoe)
thsts a lot of the story. if needed i can give better details.
